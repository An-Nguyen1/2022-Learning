# 2022-Learning
Robot Project to teach the API and practice for the upcoming season

# Setup Instructions
To download and install the necessary components for this, please go here: https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html
After setting up wpilib and vscode, please intall git (if you don't already have it): https://git-scm.com/downloads
Then, fork this repository and use git to make a copy on your computer. I will show this during our meeting, if you need help let me know.

# Practice Instructions
You should now be set up for making our practice programs. We are using a specifc coding paradigm called command-based, this is just the way the subsystems and various parts of our code will interact. Command-based programming is more complex but will allow us to do more complicated things easier. I will be showing you how to make two functional subsystems.

First we will be discussing how to make a Drivetrain subsystem. Every subsystem is made up of a subsystem class and a commands class, these are used to define what the subsystem is and what it does respectively. First you will want to find your way to the 2022-Learning/src/main/java/frc/robot/ folder, this contains all of the code that we will be worrying about. Inside of this folder you should find a subsystems folder, in the folder you should find a file named ExampleSubsystem.java, duplicate the file and rename it to YOURNAME_DrivetrainSubsystem.java. I will go over the the programming part in our meeting.

# Sidenote - HACKTOBERFEST!
Hacktoberfest is a yearly celbration of open source programming. If you signup to on the hacktoberfest website and make four pull requests in october you will get a free shirt, this is completely optional but if you would like to participate we should hopefully be doing enough in robotics to get all four but you can also make pr outside of this to get the shirt. https://hacktoberfest.com/auth/
